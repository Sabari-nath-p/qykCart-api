## Integration with Orders

### Automatic Credit Processing

When an order is placed with `paymentMethod: "CREDIT"`:

1. **Validation**: Ensures `customerPhone` is provided
2. **Account Resolution**: 
   - Finds existing credit account by phone number
   - Creates new account automatically if none exists
3. **Credit Addition**: Adds order total to customer's credit balance
4. **Order Linking**: Links order to credit transaction (prevents duplicate credit entries)
5. **Payment Status**: Marks order as PAID since it's on credit

### Order API Enhancement

```typescript
// Enhanced CreateOrderDto
{
  "cartId": "uuid",
  "orderType": "SHOP_PICKUP",
  "paymentMethod": "CREDIT",
  "customerPhone": "+1234567890", // Required for CREDIT payments
  "shopPickupDetails": { ... }
}
```

### Business Rules

1. **One Order, One Credit**: Each order can only be added to credit system once
2. **Phone-Based Accounts**: Credit accounts are uniquely identified by phone per shop
3. **Auto-Account Creation**: System creates credit accounts automatically for new customers
4. **Credit Limits**: Shop owners can set maximum credit limits per customer
5. **Balance Validation**: Payments cannot exceed current outstanding balance

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Credit Customer
```typescript
// Customer places order with credit payment
const order = {
  cartId: "cart-uuid",
  orderType: "SHOP_PICKUP",
  paymentMethod: "CREDIT",
  customerPhone: "+919876543210"
};

// System automatically:
// 1. Creates credit account for +919876543210
// 2. Adds order total (‚Çπ500) to credit
// 3. Marks order as PAID
// 4. Links order to credit transaction
```

### Scenario 2: Existing Customer Additional Credit
```typescript
// Customer with existing credit account places new order
// System:
// 1. Finds existing credit account
// 2. Checks credit limit (if set)
// 3. Adds new credit amount
// 4. Updates running balance
```

### Scenario 3: Payment Recording
```typescript
// Shop owner receives payment from customer
const payment = {
  amount: 300,
  remarks: "Partial payment received in cash"
};

// System:
// 1. Validates payment amount <= outstanding balance
// 2. Reduces customer's credit balance
// 3. Records payment transaction
// 4. Updates account balances
```

## Credit Limit Management

### Setting Credit Limits
```typescript
const updateAccount = {
  creditLimit: 5000, // ‚Çπ5,000 maximum credit
  notes: "Trusted customer, good payment history"
};
```

### Credit Limit Validation
- When adding credit, system checks if new balance would exceed limit
- Shop owners can set `creditLimit: 0` for unlimited credit
- Credit limit changes are tracked in account update history

## Analytics & Reporting

### Shop Credit Summary
```typescript
{
  "totalAccounts": 150,
  "activeAccounts": 142,
  "totalCreditGiven": 875000,     // ‚Çπ8,75,000
  "totalPaymentsReceived": 640000, // ‚Çπ6,40,000
  "totalOutstandingBalance": 235000, // ‚Çπ2,35,000
  "recentTransactions": [...]
}
```

### Customer Credit Profile
```typescript
{
  "customerPhone": "+919876543210",
  "shops": [
    {
      "shopName": "Village General Store",
      "currentBalance": 1500,

      "lastCreditDate": "2024-01-15",
