## API Endpoints

### Core Order Operations
- `POST /orders` - Create order from cart
- `GET /orders` - List orders with filtering
- `GET /orders/:id` - Get order details
- `PATCH /orders/:id/status` - Update order status
- `DELETE /orders/:id` - Cancel order

### Order Modification (Shop Owners)
- `POST /orders/:id/items` - Add item to order
- `PATCH /orders/:id/items/:itemId` - Update order item

- `GET /orders/user/:userId` - Get orders for specific user
- `GET /orders/analytics/summary` - Order analytics

## Business Logic

### Order Creation Process
1. Validate cart exists and has items
2. Verify shop delivery capabilities for delivery orders
3. Calculate order totals from cart items
4. Create order with unique order number
5. Convert cart items to order items
6. Clear cart after successful order creation

### Status Transition Rules
- ORDER_PLACED â†’ PROCESSING, CANCELLED
- PROCESSING â†’ PACKED, CANCELLED
- PACKED â†’ DELIVERED, CANCELLED
- DELIVERED â†’ (Final state)
- CANCELLED â†’ (Final state)

### Shop Modifications
- Shop owners can add/modify items during PROCESSING status
- All modifications are tracked in modification history
- Price changes and additions require proper authorization
- Stock validation applies to shop-added items

## Payment Method Management

### Update Payment Method Feature
Shop owners can change the payment method of orders before delivery, providing flexibility for customer preferences.

#### Supported Payment Methods
- **Cash on Delivery (COD)**: Cash payment at delivery time
- **Cash on Pickup**: Cash payment when picking up from shop
- **Credit**: Payment via shop credit balance
- **Online Payment**: Digital payment methods
- **UPI**: Unified Payments Interface
- **Card**: Credit/Debit card payments
- **Wallet**: Digital wallet payments

#### Business Rules
1. **Timing Restrictions**: Payment method can only be changed before order is delivered or cancelled
2. **Permission Control**: Only shop owners can modify payment methods for their orders
3. **Credit Validation**: When switching to credit payment, system validates sufficient credit balance
4. **Status Reset**: Payment status is reset to PENDING when payment method changes
5. **History Tracking**: All payment method changes are logged with reason and timestamp

#### API Endpoint
```http
PATCH /orders/{orderId}/payment-method
Authorization: Bearer {shop_owner_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "paymentMethod": "credit",
  "reason": "Customer requested to use shop credit",
  "notes": "Customer has sufficient balance"
}
```

#### Response Example
```json
{
  "id": "order-uuid",
  "orderNumber": "ORD12345",
  "paymentMethod": "credit",
  "paymentStatus": "pending",
  "modificationHistory": [
    {
      "field": "paymentMethod",
      "oldValue": "cash_on_delivery",
      "newValue": "credit",
      "reason": "Customer requested to use shop credit",
      "changedBy": "shop-owner-uuid",
      "changedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### FCM Notifications
When payment method is updated, the customer receives a push notification:
- **Title**: "ðŸ’³ Payment Method Updated"
- **Message**: "Payment method for order ORD12345 changed to Shop Credit at Village Store"
- **Data**: Includes order details, old/new payment methods, and shop information

#### Error Scenarios
- **Insufficient Credit**: When switching to credit, validates customer has sufficient balance
- **Invalid Status**: Cannot change payment method for delivered/cancelled orders
- **Permission Denied**: Only shop owners can update payment methods for their orders
- **Invalid Payment Method**: Validates payment method is supported
