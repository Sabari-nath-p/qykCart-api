  - `notes` (optional): Additional notes

#### 2. **Database Schema Updated** âœ…
- **File**: `src/modules/orders/entities/order.entity.ts`
- **Added**: `modificationHistory` field to track payment method changes
- **Type**: JSON array storing field changes with timestamps and user info

#### 3. **Service Method Added** âœ…
- **File**: `src/modules/orders/orders.service.ts`
- **Method**: `updatePaymentMethod()`
- **Features**:
  - âœ… Permission validation (shop owners only)

  - âœ… Credit balance validation when switching to credit payment
  - âœ… Payment status reset when method changes
  - âœ… Modification history tracking
  - âœ… FCM notification to customer
  - âœ… Transaction wrapper for data consistency

#### 4. **Controller Endpoint Added** âœ…
